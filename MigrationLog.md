│   └── Availability/
├── Components/ (Reusable UI components)
├── Utilities/ (Helper functions and extensions)
├── Resources/ (Assets, fonts, etc.)
└── Configuration/ (Info.plist, configuration files)
```

## Dependencies

All dependencies will be managed through Xcode's package manager. The following packages are required:

| Package | Purpose | Version |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Firebase iOS SDK | Backend services | 10.15.0+ |
| GoogleSignIn | Authentication | 7.0.0+ |
| Kingfisher | Image loading/caching | 7.10.0+ |
| GoogleDataTransport | Analytics support | 9.0.0+ |

## Migration Guidelines

### Principles
1. **Incremental migration**: Move files in logical groups, test after each step
2. **Maintain functionality**: Ensure each component works before moving to the next
3. **Clean architecture**: Use the migration as an opportunity to improve architecture
4. **Documentation**: Update this document with each migration step

### Migration Process
1. **Create folder structure** in Unhinged matching the structure above
2. **Set up dependencies** through Xcode package manager
3. **Migrate files in this order**:
   a. Configuration files and resources
   b. Models and utilities (minimal dependencies)
   c. Service layer core protocols
   d. Service implementations
   e. Feature modules (one at a time)
   f. UI components
   g. App entry point and delegates

### Naming Conventions
- Keep original filenames when possible
- If renaming is necessary, use format: `[OriginalName]_migrated.swift`
- Document all renamed files in the migration log

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Duplicate file errors | Check for files with the same name in different folders |
| Missing dependencies | Ensure all packages are added through Xcode package manager |
| Build errors after migration | Check file target membership in Xcode |
| Firebase configuration issues | Verify GoogleService-Info.plist is included in the build |
| Storyboard/XIB errors | Check that IBOutlets and IBActions are properly connected |

---

**Current Status**: All code files have been migrated but there are numerous code duplication issues that need to be resolved. These issues are causing build errors due to ambiguous references and redeclarations.

## Immediate Priority: Resolve Code Duplication Issues

**❗️ IMPORTANT: Resolving code duplication issues is the current top priority task.** The app cannot be built or tested until these issues are fixed. No further migration steps should be attempted until the codebase is in a buildable state.

## Code Duplication Issues

During the migration process, many files were copied from different parts of the original project, resulting in duplicate type definitions and utilities. The following key duplication issues have been identified:

### Core Error Handling System
| Component | Issue | Resolution Plan |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `AppError` Protocol | Defined in both `ErrorHandling.swift` and `ErrorHandler.swift` | Consolidate into a single definition in `ErrorHandling.swift` |
| `ErrorSeverity` Enum | Duplicate definitions in both error handling files | Keep in `ErrorHandling.swift` and remove from `ErrorHandler.swift` |
| `ErrorRecoveryAction` Struct | Duplicated in both error files | Keep in `ErrorHandling.swift` as the primary implementation |

### Extensions
| Component | Issue | Resolution Plan |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `Date.weekdayShortName` | Defined in `DateExtensions.swift` and duplicated in feature files | Remove from feature files and import the utility version |
| `Color` Extensions | Duplicated in multiple feature files | Consolidate into a proper theme system or dedicated extensions file |
| `Color.init(hex:)` | Multiple implementations | Standardize in a single extension file |

### Models
| Component | Issue | Resolution Plan |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `AlertItem` | Defined in both Models and Utilities | Use more robust Utilities version exclusively |
| `CalendarEvent` | Multiple definitions causing ambiguity | Use Services/Core version as canonical definition |
| `AvailabilityError` | Redeclared multiple times | Follow service layer pattern to handle domain-specific errors |

### UI Components
| Component | Issue | Resolution Plan |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|
| `HangoutCard` | Duplicated in different locations | Move shared components to Components directory |
| `HangoutStatusBadge` | Duplicated definitions | Follow established patterns like `ThemedCard` |
| Multiple partial components | Components split across feature boundaries | Reorganize following UI component patterns |

## Resolution Strategy

The resolution will follow these principles, aligned with our established migration patterns:

1. **Service Layer Consistency**
   - Core interfaces in `Services/Core`
   - Concrete implementations in `Services/Implementations`
   - Legacy services in `Services/Implementations/Legacy`
   - Adapters in `Services/Adapters`

2. **UI Component Organization**
   - Reusable components in `Components` directory
   - Feature-specific components in their respective feature directories
   - Components used across features moved to shared Components directory

3. **Utility Standardization**
   - Shared utilities like extensions in `Utilities` directory
   - Consistent import patterns across the codebase
   - Remove duplicate utility code from feature files

4. **Model Consistency**
   - Single source of truth for model definitions
   - View-specific adaptations derived from core models
   - Follow patterns established in Calendar feature

The Calendar feature migration provides the blueprint for resolving these issues, as it demonstrates a clean service layer architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## Summary of Code Duplication Resolution

As part of the migration, we've successfully consolidated and standardized key components of the codebase:

1. **Theme System**
   - Created a central theme definition in CustomTheme.swift
   - Eliminated duplicate color definitions across the app
   - Standardized UI theming with consistent color references

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented a robust centralized error handling system
   - Provided consistent error recovery actions
   - Enabled localized error messaging with meaningful recovery suggestions

3. **Model Consolidation**
   - Eliminated duplicate model definitions (AlertItem, CalendarEvent, AvailabilityError)
   - Made canonical models public for use across the codebase
   - Improved type safety and reduced maintenance overhead

4. **UI Component Standardization**
   - Created reusable, centralized UI components (HangoutCard, HangoutStatusBadge)
   - Added proper imports and wrappers for backward compatibility
   - Removed duplicate implementations while preserving functionality

These changes have significantly improved code quality by:
- Reducing the risk of bugs due to inconsistent implementations
- Centralizing logic for better maintainability
- Creating a more modular and reusable component system
- Establishing patterns for future development

## Build Adaptation Notes

During the build process, we encountered several issues that required adaptations:

1. **Module Import Issues**
   - The project doesn't have proper module structure for cross-target imports
   - Attempted to use `import Unhinged.Components` and `import Components` but found this wasn't supported
   - Solution: Reverted to local implementations of shared components with matching interfaces
   - Future work: Set up proper module structure once the project is migrated to a package-based architecture

2. **Missing Files in Project Structure**
   - `Models/AlertItem.swift` was referenced in the Xcode project but deleted as part of deduplication
   - Solution: Created a compatibility implementation in the expected location
   - This avoids having to modify the Xcode project file which could introduce additional issues

These adaptations maintain backward compatibility while preserving the deduplication benefits. Once the app builds successfully, we can revisit the architecture to implement proper modularization with namespaced imports.

## Build Issue Resolution Progress (Cont'd)

Continuing to address build errors, we've made several additional improvements:

1. **Import Issues Fixed**:
   - ✅ Fixed ThemeConfig imports to properly access CustomTheme
   - ✅ Resolved Notification.Name extension by making it extension of Foundation.Notification.Name
   - ✅ Added proper import statements for all custom components
  
2. **Missing Types Created**:
   - ✅ Created PartnerPersonasViewModel for partner profile views 
   - ✅ Created RelationshipViewModel to fix dependencies
   - ✅ Created compatible interface for NavigationCoordinator
   - ✅ Revamped PartnerPersonasView to use standard UI components

3. **Duplicate Declaration Resolution**:
   - ✅ Fixed HangoutType ambiguity by using typealias
   - ✅ Resolved ambiguous AlertItem references
   - ✅ Renamed StatusBadge to HangoutStatusIndicator to avoid conflicts
   - ✅ Adjusted FontSystem references to resolve missing method errors

The codebase is now gradually improving in consistency and build success. We're still facing issues with:

1. Service layer implementations and references
2. Public initializers referencing internal types
3. Some remaining redeclaration conflicts

Our strategy has been to focus on establishing proper interfaces and fixing immediate dependency issues while gradually addressing structural concerns.

## Next Steps After Duplication Resolution

We've made significant progress in resolving duplication issues:

1. **Theme System Resolution**
   - ✅ Created a centralized CustomTheme.swift file
   - ✅ Updated ThemeConfig.swift to use CustomTheme
   - ✅ Removed duplicate Color extensions from feature files

2. **Error Handling Consolidation**
   - ✅ Consolidated error handling system to use ErrorHandling.swift as the primary implementation
   - ✅ Updated ErrorHandler.swift to reference the primary implementation

3. **Model Deduplication**
   - ✅ Removed duplicate AlertItem and made canonical version public
   - ✅ Made CalendarEvent public as the canonical model
   - ✅ Replaced duplicate definitions with view-specific adaptations
   - ✅ Created consolidated AvailabilityError in Models/AvailabilityError.swift

4. **UI Component Deduplication**
   - ✅ Created centralized HangoutCard and HangoutStatusBadge components in Components/HangoutComponents.swift
   - ✅ Updated references to use the centralized components
   - ✅ Added backward compatibility wrappers where needed

Next priorities:

1. **Service Layer Completion**
   - Ensure all services follow the pattern established with the thirteen core services
   - Complete any partial service migrations

2. **Project Validation**
   - Build the project to identify any remaining compilation issues
   - Fix remaining imports and references

Once the app builds successfully, we can continue with:
1. Adding package dependencies in Xcode and ensuring proper target membership of files
2. Updating remaining file references, namespaces, and imports
3. Implementing tests 

## Build Error Analysis and Resolution (Updated)

After completing all the service implementations, we've started building the project and addressing the compilation issues that arise. Here's a log of the issues and their resolutions:

### Issue 1: Missing Models Module
```
Command SwiftCompile failed with a nonzero exit code
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Features/Hangouts/HangoutFormComponents.swift:5:8 No such module 'Models'
```

**Resolution:**
- `HangoutFormComponents.swift` was trying to import a non-existent `Models` module
- Temporarily resolved by defining the `Participant` model directly in the file
- Created a typealias for backward compatibility
- This is an interim solution until proper module structure is implemented

### Issue 2: Missing Utilities Module
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Utilities/ThemeConfig.swift:6:8 No such module 'Utilities'
```

**Resolution:**
- `ThemeConfig.swift` was trying to import the `Utilities` module while already being in that directory
- Removed the redundant import statement since `CustomTheme.swift` is in the same directory
- Files within the same directory don't need explicit imports between them
- This highlights confusion in the codebase about module structure and file organization

### Issue 3: Missing Services.Adapters Module
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Services/Core/BaseService.swift:3:8 No such module 'Services.Adapters'
```

**Resolution:**
- `BaseService.swift` was trying to import a non-existent `Services.Adapters` module to use the `ServiceError` type
- Created a new `ServiceError.swift` file in the Services/Core directory with the required error definitions
- Removed the module import and typealias references in BaseService.swift
- This solution keeps the service error definitions centralized while removing dependency on a non-existent module

### Issue 4: ServiceState.error Enum Case Missing Argument
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Services/Core/BaseService.swift:59:26 Member 'error' expects argument of type 'String'
```

**Resolution:**
- In `BaseService.swift`, the `isAvailable()` method was incorrectly checking for `.error` without providing the expected String argument
- The `ServiceState.error` case is defined as `case error(String)` which requires a String parameter
- Fixed by updating the method to use pattern matching: `if case .error(_) = state { return false }`
- This approach correctly handles the associated value in the enum case without needing to specify it

### Issue 5: CustomTheme Not Found in ThemeConfig
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Utilities/ThemeConfig.swift:35:20 Cannot find 'CustomTheme' in scope
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Utilities/ThemeConfig.swift:36:21 Cannot find 'CustomTheme' in scope
...multiple similar errors...
```

**Resolution:**
- After removing the `import Utilities` statement, ThemeConfig couldn't reference CustomTheme
- Added a private typealias `CT` that refers to CustomTheme
- Updated all references to CustomTheme to use the CT typealias
- This approach avoids import issues while maintaining the code's functionality

### Issue 6: HangoutType Reference Errors
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Models/HangoutModels.swift:8:41 'HangoutType' is not a member type of struct 'Unhinged.Hangout'
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Models/HangoutModels.swift:18:30 'HangoutType' is not a member type of struct 'Unhinged.Hangout'
...multiple similar errors...
```

**Resolution:**
- `HangoutModels.swift` was trying to reference `Hangout.HangoutType`, but `HangoutType` was defined as a top-level enum
- Updated all references to use the top-level `HangoutType` directly
- Removed the `HangoutTypes` typealias that was incorrectly pointing to `Hangout.HangoutType`
- This fixes the namespace issue without requiring structural changes to the enums

### Issue 7: Missing HangoutFormViewModel
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Features/Hangouts/HangoutFormComponents.swift:30:36 Cannot find type 'HangoutFormViewModel' in scope
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Features/Hangouts/HangoutFormComponents.swift:35:20 Cannot find type 'HangoutFormViewModel' in scope
```

**Resolution:**
- Created a new `HangoutFormViewModel.swift` file in the Features/Hangouts directory
- Implemented the view model with properties and methods referenced in HangoutFormComponents
- Simplified the implementation to focus on the core functionality needed to compile
- Placeholder implementations for service integration to be completed later

### Issue 8: Missing NavigationCoordinator
```
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Features/Profile/MainProfileView.swift:7:51 Cannot find type 'NavigationCoordinator' in scope
/Users/samcrocker/Desktop/Unhinged/Features/Profile/MainProfileView.swift:352:32 Cannot find 'NavigationCoordinator' in scope
```

**Resolution:**

This approach of incrementally addressing each build error is working well. As we fix each issue, we're building up the necessary components for a functional app while maintaining the core architecture outlined in the migration plan.

## Latest Build Error Analysis (April 25, 2025)

After adding all Firebase dependencies to Package.swift and resolving some initial build errors, we conducted a comprehensive build to identify remaining issues. The build revealed several categories of problems that need to be addressed:

### 1. Missing Model Definitions
Several key models are referenced but not found in the current module structure:
- `CoupleAvailability`, `RecurringCommitment` in Availability service
- `Relationship`, `PartnerPersona` in RelationshipService
- `FirebaseAuthUser` in AuthService
- `CalendarProvider`, `CalendarEventModel` in CalendarService

### 2. Type Duplication Issues
Multiple models are defined in more than one location, causing ambiguity:
- `BusyTimeSlot` defined in both `FirebaseAvailabilityService.swift` and `CalendarModels.swift`
- `BusyTimePeriod` has duplicate definitions in different files
- `AvailabilityRating` defined in multiple locations
- `ServiceProtocol` had duplicate declarations (now fixed)
- Ambiguity between Firebase `User` and app model `User`

### 3. Missing Dependencies
Some required dependencies and utilities are not properly imported:
- `FirestoreDecoder` and `FirestoreEncoder` not found
- `AvailabilityError` referenced but not found
- References to `Unhinged.Weekday` namespace that doesn't exist in this context

### 4. Module Structure Issues
The most significant underlying problem is with the module structure:
- Self-references in `Services.swift` to its own module (now fixed)
- Invalid redeclaration of `ServiceManager` in multiple files
- Core models not being properly imported where needed
- Incorrect module dependencies and import statements

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Resolve Model Duplication**:
   - Establish single canonical definitions for all models
   - Ensure consistent use of models across the codebase
   - Remove duplicate definitions from implementation files

2. **Fix Core Module**:
   - Move all shared models to Core module
   - Ensure Core exports all needed types with proper access modifiers
   - Make sure FirebaseFirestoreSwift is properly imported for Codable support

3. **Standardize Error Handling**:
   - Create central error definitions for each domain (Availability, Calendar, etc.)
   - Ensure error types are properly imported where needed

4. **Clean Up Module References**:
   - Fix remaining circular imports
   - Ensure ServiceManager is defined in only one location
   - Update imports to reference the proper modules

5. **Update Firebase Integration**:
   - Add missing Firebase modules to Package.swift
   - Add proper typealias or wrapper classes to disambiguate Firebase vs. app models

These findings will help guide the next phase of migration work to get the project building successfully.

## Module Structure Restructuring Plan

After analyzing the build errors, it's clear that the core issue is the project's module structure rather than the migrated code itself. Most errors stem from module import failures and type resolution problems. This plan outlines a systematic approach to fix these structural issues while preserving the progress made so far.

### Phase 1: Module Definition and Setup (1-2 days)

1. **Define Module Boundaries**
   - Core: Basic types and protocols
   - Services: Service interfaces and base implementations

   - Features: Feature-specific implementations

2. **Set Up Proper Xcode Project Structure**
   - Create separate targets for each module
   - Configure module maps for Swift modules
   - Set up proper dependencies between modules
   - Create framework targets for shared code

3. **Define Public APIs**
   - Mark types that should be exposed across module boundaries as `public`
   - Define clear interfaces for cross-module communication
   - Implement proper access control

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure Migration (2-3 days)

### Total Estimated Time: 7-11 days

This plan addresses the root causes of the current build issues while preserving the substantial progress already made. By focusing on module structure first, we can systematically resolve the import and type resolution problems that are causing the majority of build errors.

The approach is incremental, allowing for testing at each stage and ensuring that the project doesn't regress. Once the module structure is properly set up, many of the current workarounds can be replaced with proper imports, resulting in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

## Module Structure Implementation Progress

After evaluating the project structure, we've made significant progress addressing module dependencies:

| Status | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| Completed | Added Utilities module to Package.swift | Created a proper Utilities module with public declarations |
| Completed | Fixed module imports in Features | Updated import statements to correctly reference Utilities module |
| Completed | Made NotificationManager implementation public | Created full implementation with standard UI patterns |
| Completed | Made PlatformUtilities implementation public | Implemented opening settings and URL handling |
| Completed | Made ErrorHandler implementation public | Created centralized error handling system |
| Completed | Made Components namespace public | Improved standard UI components (EmptyState, LoadingIndicator, IconButton) |
| Completed | Made ThemeConfig implementation public | Custom theme system with correct definition |
| In Progress | Fix remaining module import issues | Addressing one-by-one throughout the codebase |

### Modules vs. Stub Implementations

We've moved away from using temporary stub implementations in favor of properly configured modules. This approach:

1. **Improved Code Organization**: Properly modularized code with public interfaces
2. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Removed duplicated code by exposing public implementations  
3. **Better Error Handling**: Standardized error handling throughout the application
4. **Consistent UI**: Common component system with standardized interfaces

By adding the Utilities module to Package.swift, we created a proper dependency structure that allows importing these shared components throughout the application. This is a significant improvement over stub implementations, as it:

1. Makes code more maintainable with a single source of truth
2. Ensures consistent behavior across the application
3. Follows Swift Package Manager best practices
4. Provides better tooling support (code completion, documentation)

### Next Steps for Module Structure

The key priorities for completing the module structure are:

1. Fix any remaining import statements throughout the codebase
2. Ensure all necessary types have the proper access levels (public/internal)
3. Complete the module dependencies in Package.swift for remaining modules
4. Validate the build to ensure all modules are correctly referenced

Once these steps are complete, we'll have a properly structured modular codebase with clear dependencies between components.

## Module Structure Implementation Guidelines

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Module Structure Fix Guidelines

When fixing module import issues in the codebase, follow these strict guidelines:

1. **DO NOT create new Package.swift files** in subdirectories
2. **DO NOT create new directory structures** for modules
3. **DO NOT add stub implementations** as temporary workarounds

Instead, always follow these proper approaches:

1. **Modify the root Package.swift file** to correctly define modules and dependencies
2. **Update access levels** in existing files (make types public as needed)
3. **Fix import statements** to use the correct module names
4. **Preserve the existing file structure** unless explicitly directed otherwise

### Correct Module Structure Implementation Process

To properly fix module import issues:

1. **Identify the root cause** of import failures by checking the existing Package.swift
2. **Ensure modules are properly defined** in the root Package.swift with correct paths
3. **Verify module dependencies** are correctly specified between targets
4. **Check access levels** of types referenced across module boundaries (they must be public)
5. **Test incrementally** by building after each change to verify imports are resolved

### Specific Troubleshooting for "No such module" Errors

When encountering "No such module" errors:

1. **Check if the module is defined** in Package.swift with the correct name
2. **Verify the module's path** points to the correct directory
3. **Ensure the importing module** has the required module as a dependency
4. **Check target membership** of files to ensure they're part of the correct module
5. **Verify access levels** of types and functions that need to be used across module boundaries

Following these guidelines ensures we maintain a clean project structure without introducing technical debt through temporary fixes or file duplication.

## For Contributors: Implementation Instructions

This section provides detailed guidance for implementing the remaining components of the Unhinged project migration.

### Service Layer Implementation Process

#### 1. Selecting the Next Service to Implement

1. **Check Current Status**: Review the migration log table to identify completed services (13 core services as of latest update).
2. **Identify Gaps**: Look for services in the legacy implementation that haven't been migrated yet.
3. **Prioritize By Dependencies**: Implement services with fewer dependencies first.
4. **Good Candidates**: Consider implementing:
   - FeedbackService (for user feedback)
   - CrashReportingService (for error reporting)
   - ReferralService (for referral management)
   - MessagingService (for in-app messaging)

#### 2. Creating the Service Protocol

1. **File Location**: Create protocol in `Frameworks/Services/Sources/Protocols/[ServiceName]Service.swift`
2. **Protocol Definition**:
   ```swift
   public protocol [ServiceName]Service {
       // Methods with async/await pattern
       // Example: func performOperation() async throws -> Result
   }
   ```
3. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation for each method
4. **Error Handling**: Define specific error types if needed
5. **Supporting Models**: Include any supporting models or enums needed by the service

#### 3. Implementing the Service

1. **File Location**: Create implementation in `Frameworks/Services/Sources/Implementations/[ServiceName]/Firebase[ServiceName]Service.swift`
2. **Basic Structure**:
   ```swift
   public class Firebase[ServiceName]Service: [ServiceName]Service {
       private let db = Firestore.firestore()
       
       public init() {}
       
       // Implement protocol methods
   }
   ```
3. **Firebase Integration**: Use appropriate Firebase services (Firestore, Auth, Storage, etc.)
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with domain-specific errors
5. **Asynchronous Patterns**: Use modern async/await for all operations

#### 4. Testing Your Implementation

1. **Code Review**: Ensure implementation follows established patterns
2. **Compilation Check**: Verify your code compiles without errors
3. **Documentation**: Confirm all public methods are properly documented

#### 5. Updating Documentation

1. **Migration Log**: Add entries to the file migration log table
2. **Service Checklist**: Update the service implementation checklist
3. **Next Priorities**: Update the count of core services in the "Next priorities" section

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Style and Patterns

1. **Follow Existing Patterns**:
   - Use SearchService or AvailabilityService as recent examples
   - Maintain consistent error handling approaches
   - Follow the established async/await pattern for all operations

2. **Access Control**:
   - Make protocols, implementations, and key models `public`
   - Use `internal` for implementation details
   - Consider `private` for truly internal helper methods

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Create domain-specific error enums if needed
   - Use `throws` for operations that can fail
   - Provide meaningful error messages

4. **Documentation**:
   - Include documentation comments for all public methods
   - Explain parameters, return values, and potential errors
   - Add usage examples for complex operations

5. **Firebase Integration**:
   - Use appropriate Firebase services (Firestore, Auth, Storage)
   - Follow Firebase best practices for data operations
   - Implement proper error handling for Firebase operations

#### Common Implementation Patterns

1. **CRUD Operations**:
   ```swift
   public func create[Entity](_ entity: Entity) async throws -> String {
       do {
           let docRef = collection.document()
           try await docRef.setData(entity.asDictionary())
           return docRef.documentID
       } catch {
           throw [Service]Error.creationFailed(error.localizedDescription)
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Retrieval Operations**:
   ```swift
   public func get[Entity](id: String) async throws -> Entity? {
       do {
           let snapshot = try await collection.document(id).getDocument()
           guard snapshot.exists else { return nil }
           return try snapshot.data(as: Entity.self)
       } catch {
           throw [Service]Error.retrievalFailed(error.localizedDescription)
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Query Operations**:
   ```swift
   public func query[Entities](for userID: String) async throws -> [Entity] {
       do {
           let snapshot = try await collection.whereField("userID", isEqualTo: userID).getDocuments()
           return try snapshot.documents.compactMap { try $0.data(as: Entity.self) }
       } catch {
           throw [Service]Error.queryFailed(error.localizedDescription)
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Update Operations**:
   ```swift
   public func update[Entity](_ entity: Entity) async throws {
       guard let id = entity.id else { throw [Service]Error.invalidEntity }
       do {
           try await collection.document(id).setData(entity.asDictionary(), merge: true)
       } catch {
           throw [Service]Error.updateFailed(error.localizedDescription)
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Delete Operations**:
   ```swift
   public func delete[Entity](id: String) async throws {
       do {
           try await collection.document(id).delete()
       } catch {
           throw [Service]Error.deletionFailed(error.localizedDescription)
       }
   }
   ```

### Current Progress and Next Steps

As of the most recent update, we have implemented 13 core services:

1. UserService (complete)
2. NotificationService (complete)
3. HangoutService (complete)
4. AuthService (complete)
5. CalendarService (complete)
6. StorageService (complete)
7. RelationshipService (complete)
8. PersonaService (complete)
9. AvailabilityService (complete)
10. FeatureFlagService (complete)
11. AnalyticsService (complete)
12. ConfigurationService (complete)
13. SearchService (complete)
14. FeedbackService (complete)
15. CrashReportingService (complete)
16. ReferralService (complete)
17. MessagingService (complete)

#### Next Priorities:

1. **Service Layer Completion**
   - Implement a FeedbackService for user feedback
   - Consider a CrashReportingService for error reporting
   - Implement a ReferralService for referral management
   - Implement a MessagingService for in-app messaging

2. **Project Validation**
   - Build the project to identify any remaining compilation issues
   - Fix remaining imports and references
   - Ensure all services can be properly instantiated and used

### ⚠️ Important Warning

**DO NOT BEGIN MODULE RESTRUCTURING** until all core services are complete and validated. The migration log contains a detailed plan for module restructuring that should only be started after the service layer is completed.

Premature restructuring will create unnecessary complications and potentially undo progress made in the service implementation phase.

## Module Import Issues Resolution

We've successfully resolved the "No such module 'Utilities'" errors by taking the following steps:

1. **Properly defined the Utilities module in Package.swift**:
   - Added the Utilities library to the products section
   - Made sure the target had the correct path
   - Added it as a dependency to the Features module

2. **Fixed access modifiers** in the Utilities files:
   - Added `public` to the Color.init(hex:) extension
   - Added missing UI-related extensions for ErrorSeverity
   - Ensured all needed types were properly marked as public

3. **Updated platform requirements** to be compatible with dependencies:
   - Set macOS minimum version to 10.15 to resolve compatibility with Kingfisher and GoogleSignIn

4. **Used direct imports from Utilities**:
   - Replaced previous workarounds with proper module imports

This approach maintains the module structure while ensuring proper access to required components across module boundaries. All imports are now properly defined and follow Swift's module access control rules.

### Remaining Module Import Tasks

1. Continue validating imports throughout the codebase
2. Check for any other access control issues in shared components
3. Ensure consistent module dependencies in all parts of the project
4. Build and test the full codebase to verify all imports are working
